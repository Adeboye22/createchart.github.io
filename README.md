# createchart.github.io
I learnt how to integrate charts into websites using apex-charts dependency.

## Method
The following steps are how I achieved the project:
- First, I created an app with the create react app.
- Then I worked on my project folder structure (creating the components, database, api folders).
- I went ahead to create a dummy api using json, and added some data to it.
- I hosted the dummy json api on a separate port using the command 
```npx json-server -p 8000 -w data/db.json``` . 
- Then I ran the app server on a separate port using 
```npm run start```
- After all these have been fulfilled, I fetched the dummy api into the app to create the chart.
